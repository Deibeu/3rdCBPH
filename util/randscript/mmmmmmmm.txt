CHALMERS: Well, SeyMMMMMMMMMMour, I MMMMMMMMMMade it... despite your directions.
SKINNER: Ah, Superintendent CHALMERS! WelcoMMMMMMMMMMe! I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!
CHALMERS: Uhh...
SKINNER: [gasp] Oh egads, MMMMMMMMMMy roast is ruined! But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as MMMMMMMMMMy own cooking? [to hiMMMMMMMMMMself] Oh ho ho ho ho... delightfully devilish, SeyMMMMMMMMMMour!
CHALMERS: Uh-
[cue song]
Skinner with his crazy explanations,
The superintendent's gonna need his MMMMMMMMMMedication,
When he hears Skinner's laMMMMMMMMMMe exaggerations,
There'll be trouble in town tonight!
[end of song]
CHALMERS: SeyMMMMMMMMMMour!
SKINNER: Superintendent, I was just, uh... just stretching MMMMMMMMMMy calves on the windowsill. IsoMMMMMMMMMMetric exercise! Care to join MMMMMMMMMMe?
CHALMERS: Why is there sMMMMMMMMMMoke coMMMMMMMMMMing out of your oven, SeyMMMMMMMMMMour?
SKINNER: Uhh... no! That isn't sMMMMMMMMMMoke. It's steaMMMMMMMMMM. SteaMMMMMMMMMM froMMMMMMMMMM the steaMMMMMMMMMMed claMMMMMMMMMMs we're having! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM... steaMMMMMMMMMMed claMMMMMMMMMMs! [beat] Ooh...
[a few MMMMMMMMMMoMMMMMMMMMMents later]
SKINNER: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for MMMMMMMMMMouthwatering haMMMMMMMMMMburgers!
CHALMERS: I thought we were having steaMMMMMMMMMMed claMMMMMMMMMMs.
SKINNER: D'oh, no. I said steaMMMMMMMMMMed haMMMMMMMMMMs! That's what I call haMMMMMMMMMMburgers!
CHALMERS: You call haMMMMMMMMMMburgers "steaMMMMMMMMMMed haMMMMMMMMMMs?"
SKINNER: Yes. It's a regional dialect!
CHALMERS: Uh-huh... uh, what region?
SKINNER: Uhh... upstate New York?
CHALMERS: Really? Well, I'MMMMMMMMMM froMMMMMMMMMM Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steaMMMMMMMMMMed haMMMMMMMMMMs."
SKINNER: Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.
CHALMERS: I see. [beat] You know, these haMMMMMMMMMMburgers are quite siMMMMMMMMMMilar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.
SKINNER: Oh ho ho ho... no, patented Skinner burgers. Old faMMMMMMMMMMily recipe.
CHALMERS: For steaMMMMMMMMMMed haMMMMMMMMMMs?
SKINNER: Yes.
CHALMERS: Yeah, so you call theMMMMMMMMMM "steaMMMMMMMMMMed haMMMMMMMMMMs" despite the fact they are obviously grilled.
SKINNER: Ye- hey- you know, the- one thing I should- excuse MMMMMMMMMMe for one second.
CHALMERS: Of course.
SKINNER: [YAWN] Well, that was wonderful. A good tiMMMMMMMMMMe was had by all, I'MMMMMMMMMM pooped.
CHALMERS: Yes, I should be- Good Lord, what is happening in there!?
SKINNER: Aurora borealis?
CHALMERS: Uh- aurora borealis!? At this tiMMMMMMMMMMe of year, at this tiMMMMMMMMMMe of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen!?
SKINNER: Yes!
CHALMERS: MMMMMMMMMMay I see it?
SKINNER: No.
SKINNER'S MMMMMMMMMMOTHER: SeyMMMMMMMMMMour, the house is on fire!
SKINNER: No, MMMMMMMMMMotherâ€”it's just the northern lights!
CHALMERS: Well, SeyMMMMMMMMMMour, you are an odd fellow, but I MMMMMMMMMMust say... you steaMMMMMMMMMM a good haMMMMMMMMMM.
SKINNER'S MMMMMMMMMMOTHER: Help! Help!
