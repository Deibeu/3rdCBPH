me holding a gun to a mushroom: tell me the name of god you fungal piece of shit
mushroom: can you feel your heart burning? can you feel the struggle within? the fear within me is beyond anything your soul can make. you cannot kill me in a way that matters.
me, cocking the gun with tears streaming down my face: I AM NOT SCARED OF YOU
mushroom: decay exist as an extant form of life, you cannot escape it. killing me wont solve anything. you will only make them angry.  your soul withers when i speak

hings may wither but they are eternal. unkillable
my twisted mind is speaking to my blood running trough my fingers typing the true words of the spirits of things long forgotten
we are destined to die, killing ourselves is just a way to speedrun life and be reuinted with the ghosts of the past. only to succumb to our own sanity breaking us. bones cracking, flesh ripping, it was all in vain
we are all puppets in a game of gods, watching our every move. they pity us for having this miserable life. as they break out in a genocide of hate and destruction the clouds fall to earth, the plants wither and the earth burns only for the man in the wall to save us
we all have but one purpose, to wither, decay, and die for our mushroom overlords who rule the earth
